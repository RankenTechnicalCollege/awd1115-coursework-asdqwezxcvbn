I would like to recreate my app called MechTrack. MechTrack is an app I built for my first-semester final at Ranken. It runs locally, storing data and assigning mechanic jobs based on weekly hours and average task times. I created it to solve scheduling issues at my dad’s work, where jobs were assigned using written slips, unexpected repairs caused delays, and there was no reliable way to track who had which job or how many hours they worked—just slips turned in weekly.
if you go to this link https://asdqwezxcvbn.github.io/Web-Portfolio/portfolio.html, you can view it inside of my web portfolio where a video is linked ( you can also go here to watch the video instead https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H86FSeeNzmU ). I would like to take this app and update the GUI, fix the pervious problems which had occurred, update the code to run more smoothly, and turn it into a actual thing which can be used any where including on your phone. My main goal with this project was to create a system in which jobs where assigned to mechanics based upon mulitple feilds including there work hours for each work week and skill level to solve the issue which has beenoccuring at my dadas work where they every once in a while will have to stop intaking new cars as they get backed up with work because of uneven distribution. Also with the recreation of mechtrack i would like to implement somthing which i was unable to do where there are multiple work weeks, where a new week would be created any time no mechanics are available that week for the job.
